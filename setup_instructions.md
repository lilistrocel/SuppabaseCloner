# Instructions for Setting Up Missing Tables and Views

## Missing Tables
To create the missing tables in your destination Supabase database:

1. Open your Supabase dashboard and navigate to the SQL Editor
2. Load the file `create_tables.sql`
3. Run the SQL commands to create all missing tables

## Views Strategy
For views, we have two recommended approaches:

### Option 1: Create as Regular Tables
1. Open your Supabase dashboard and navigate to the SQL Editor
2. Load the file `create_views_as_tables.sql`
3. Run the SQL commands to create tables with the same structure as the views

### Option 2: Recreate the Actual Views
For this approach, you'll need to:
1. Extract the view definitions from your source database (requires admin privileges)
2. Create the same views in your destination database

Since we don't have admin access to your source database, we can't automatically extract the view definitions.
However, you may be able to:
1. Use the Supabase dashboard in your source project to see the SQL that defines each view
2. Copy those definitions and run them in your destination project

## After Creating Tables and Views
Once you've created all the missing tables and views, you can run the data cloning process:

```
npm start
```

This will copy all the data from your source database to your destination database.
